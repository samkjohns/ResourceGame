# Battle

When a creature-stack attempts to move into the space of another stack, the two stacks battle until one is wiped out.

## Turns and Initiative

An initiative order is formed at the start of battle. Each creature is assigned an initiative value (IV). This value is based partly on chance, but is modified by the creature's speed.

On each turn, a creature may make one movement and take one action.

### Actions

Actions consist of attacks, spells, or possibly other.

Only humanoids can carry weapons. Therefore, only humanoids may make ranged attacks. Melee attacks are modified by strength, and ranged attacks by dexterity.

Spells can be at any range, but a creature is limited in the number of spells they can cast by their intelligence.



## Death

A creature dies when its current HP reaches 0.
